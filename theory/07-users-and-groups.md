# Linux Users and Groups
Linux is a **multi-user operating system**, which means multiple users can access the same system while having different accounts and permissions.

## Users
A **user account** represents a person or a process that interacts with the Linux system.
Each user has an identity and can have specific access permissions.
Linux user information is associated with:
* **Username**
* **User ID (UID)**
* **Primary group**
* **Home directory**

---

## Root User
The **root user** is the superuser in Linux.
Root has extensive privileges and can perform administrative tasks that normal users cannot.
Because of these privileges, the root account should be used carefully.

---

## Groups
A **group** is a collection of users.
Groups are mainly used to organize users and manage access to system resources.
A user can belong to:
* One primary group
* One or more secondary groups
For example:
```text
Developers
├── User A
├── User B
└── User C
```

Permissions can then be assigned to the group instead of configuring access for every user individually.

---

## User and Group Identification
Linux identifies users and groups using numerical IDs.
* **UID** — User ID
* **GID** — Group ID

These IDs are used internally by the system to identify users and groups.

---

## User and Group Management
Linux allows administrators to:
* Create users
* Remove users
* Modify user information
* Create groups
* Remove groups
* Add users to groups

This provides a structured way to manage access to system resources.

* Each user has a unique UID.
* Root is the superuser.
* Groups organize users and simplify access management.
* Each user has a primary group and can belong to additional groups.
* Linux uses UIDs and GIDs to identify users and groups.
